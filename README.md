# Tango Fox

Tango Fox is a bare minimum FTP server that I wrote for the purpose of transferring photographs from my camera to my laptop. `libunftp` does all the heavy lifting for me.

## Usage

```shell
# starts a server that will automatically shut down after five minutes
$ tangofox --timeout 5m
Ftp running on port 2121
```

At present, usernames and passwords and ssh keys and SSL and just... security of any kind in generalâ€”none of that stuff is supported. Use at your own risk.

Or you can risk corrupting your images with crappy card readers and/or damaging your card slots with constant in-and-out. I know which option I picked, but reasonable people could easily reach different conclusions!
